# Print-the-Elements-of-a-Linked-List2 This C# code defines a simple singly linked list structure with nodes containing integer data and a reference to the next node.
It sets up the framework for inserting nodes and includes a placeholder function `printLinkedList` to later display all node values starting from the head.
